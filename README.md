### Hi, I'm Naveen ðŸ‘‹  

I am a materials scientist by training who now works as a data scientist. While in my PhD program, I got more and more
interested in coding, especially in Python, which I used to automate and solve some of my research problems. The thrill
of finding a story from all the experimental data I collected is what eventually led me into the field of data science. 
I'm also a huge sports fan, so I like to analyze data from different sports and I always love a great sports data visualization. 
I have also compiled some of my work into blog posts on Medium, which are listed below. Would love to connect and collaborate 
with other data scientists and experimental scientists who are interested in how coding and data science can help them advance 
their research.
